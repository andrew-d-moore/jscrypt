# jscrypt
JSCrypt – Node.js Cryptography Utility Library

Designed and implemented a Node.js library that wraps the built-in Crypto module to provide a consistent, ergonomic API for hashing and encryption across services.

Abstracted low-level Crypto primitives into higher-level helpers for common operations (e.g., hashing, symmetric encryption/decryption), reducing boilerplate and configuration errors in application code.

​
Standardized algorithm choices, key/IV handling, and encoding formats to ensure secure and predictable cryptographic behavior across multiple Node.js projects.

​
Published the library as a reusable internal dependency, improving maintainability and enabling quick adoption of updated cryptographic best practices from a single codebase.
